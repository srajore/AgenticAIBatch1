# Conditional Workflow: Discount Calculator
# This workflow calculates a discount on a purchase based on the total amount:
# • If total ≥ 100, apply a 20% discount.
# • If 50 ≤ total < 100, apply a 10% discount.
# • If total < 50, no discount.
# The workflow takes the purchase amount, checks eligibility, and applies the appropriate discount.
